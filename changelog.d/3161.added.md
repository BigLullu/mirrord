### Added

- Introduced new error handling for critical internal proxy failures,
  ensuring the state is marked as broken and propagated to layers.
  Added related mechanisms to send meaningful failure messages to layers
  whenever the proxy's internal state is compromised. Includes a test
  validating this behavior.
